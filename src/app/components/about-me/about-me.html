    <h3>Hi,</h3>
    I’m a frontend developer with 3.5 years of experience turning ideas into
    sleek, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. I work mainly with
    Angular, TypeScript, and modern JavaScript frameworks, and I have a soft
    spot for clean, maintainable code and thoughtful UI details that make
    people’s lives a little easier. I like to think of my work as a mix of logic
    and creativity — part engineering, part design intuition. I’m always curious
    about why users behave the way they do and how a small tweak can make a big
    difference in their experience. When I’m not building interfaces, you’ll
    probably find me on my second cup of coffee, trying to learn Korean (with
    occasional movie-quote detours), or overanalyzing film characters like
    they’re real people I know. I’m a lifelong vegetarian, a quiet thinker, and
    a believer that every great project starts with curiosity… and maybe snacks.
